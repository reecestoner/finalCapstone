Holiday Cost Calculator

## Description

The Holiday Cost Calculator is a Python program that helps users estimate the cost of their holiday based on their chosen destination, the number of nights they plan to stay, and whether they require a car rental. The program prompts the user for input, validates it, and calculates the costs accordingly. It provides itemized costs for flights, hotel accommodation, and car rental (if applicable), as well as the total cost of the holiday.
